            Hello there, my name is Shishir Iyer. I currently attend UC San Diego, where I'm an incoming third year majoring in computer science. 
            I am also currently a software engineering intern working at Intuit. In my free time, I love hiking, doing photography, going out for runs, 
            and playing video games (my favorites include Super Smash Brothers Ultimate, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and Minecraft). I enjoy working on fun little 
            random coding projects, some of which involve other (non tech-related) topics like the weather. This sort of interdisciplinary work is something 
            that I hope to continue in the future.
        </p>
