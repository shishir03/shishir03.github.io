There is minimal cloudiness all year round and temperatures are extremely high, often above 40 °C, in some places even more than 45 °C. It in fact includes the warmest places on Earth, however, this is not to say it is not cold here at all. Due to the minimal cloud cover, it cools down very rapidly after sunset and sometimes even freezes in the early morning hours, just before sunrise. Hot deserts are found especially in Northern Africa, the most well-known is the largest desert on Earth, the Sahara desert. Then there are also hot deserts in the Middle East, Central and West Australia or some parts of Southwest U.S. and Southwest Africa.</p><p>Cold desert regions have a slightly misleading name because the word “cold” must be considered in context – summers here are still extremely hot and dry. In the winter however, temperatures drop quite significantly, sometimes well below freezing point. Cold desert regions are often found in places with higher altitude. Regions with this climate type are for example in Central Asia, the most well-known is the Mongolian Gobi desert.</p>";
